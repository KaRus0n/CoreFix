This is an old version of a project called CoreFix.
It was originally created to solve performance issues in a specific game I was playing, but unfortunately it didn’t help much.
I stopped working on it because the game is now dead, and the tool wasn’t really effective in the end.

Two years later, I decided to release this early alpha version anyway — just in case someone finds it useful or wants to look at the logic behind it
